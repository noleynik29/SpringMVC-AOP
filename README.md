# SpringMVC-AOP

Java Spring App using: spring web mvc, javax servlet, mysql connector java, c3p0, spring orm, hibernate core and aspectj.

his is a project of my spring mvc study, using spring 5.3.19

To run this project better use the newest version of IntelliJ IDEA, JDK 1.8_x, Tomcat 9.0.x and newest version of MySQL Workbench.

Also you need to download and run this ([settings.txt](https://github.com/noleynik29/SpringMVC-AOP/files/9559543/settings.txt)) sql code to create database, that will be used in app.

If you've got any problems caused by this upgration, better look up the documents in Spring Framework Reference.

Firstly, when you start this application with Tomcat, you will see this simple web-page:

After clicking "Add" you will see a new view, where you can write "Employee Info" to add new employee:
